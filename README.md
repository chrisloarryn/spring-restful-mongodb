# spring-boot-restful-service
Spring Boot RESTful service with aggregation and date relationship in the domain model following data transfer object(DTO) architecture with a regular MVC and a service layer. A simple order/customer API with C.R.U.D operations.
This repo is focusing mainly on different REST test api frameworks for this API and also to play around with Spring Docs for a better API documentation experience.
